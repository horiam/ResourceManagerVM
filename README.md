# ResourceManagerVM

**Overview**

This is the **Vagrant** environment coupled with a **Puppet** provisioning that will spin up a **VM** and install and deploy the **ResourceManager** project on it, ready for use. 

**Requirements**

In order to use this Vagrant environment, you need to install the latest *VirtualBox* and *Vagrant*. 

**Usage**

Once all the requirements satisfied, clone or download this git project and go into the directory where it is to run: 
```
vagrant up
```
It could take at least 30 minutes for the VM to be provisioned (due to the maven build and TomEE download) depending on your machineâ€™s power and Internet connection.

Once the VM is up, you can use the ResourceManager services through _http://localhost:8081_. For example, you can directly take a look in your browser at this address: 
[http://admin:admin@localhost:8081/ResourceManager/rest/resources/](http://admin:admin@localhost:8081/ResourceManager/rest/resources/)

See the _ResourceManager_ manual page for more details about how to use it.

**Reference**

When you _up_ Vagrant, it will provision the VM with Puppet. Puppet will install _openjdk, git, maven and mysql_. TomEE is downloaded and to be extracted. We clone the ResourceManager git repo and build it with maven. The resulting war will be deployed in TomEE. 

We then add a database and user in MySQL and the corresponding data resource file in TomEE as well as a freshly downloaded mysql connector jar. 
We also add two users to the TomEE authentication.
